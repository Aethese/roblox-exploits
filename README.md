# Credit
Some were made by me, some weren't, you can see on the readme pages for more info on the script.

# Updates and other script info
If the scripts were patched, I'm not gonna fix them to work again, don't create an issue over something like that. Only create issues if a script doesn't work (or you can create a pull request too). If you found the owner for a script, start an issue with the readme file (or create a wiki forum) and title it with the creator's name and a link to your proof.

# Legality
Everything you can see here has been made for educational purposes and proof of concepts. I do not promote the usage of my tools, I do not take responsability on the bad usage of this tool.

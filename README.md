# Credit
Some were made by me, some weren't, you can see on the readme pages for more info on the script.

# Updates and other script info
If the scripts were patched, I'm not usually gonna fix them to work again, so only scripts that are easily fixed will get fixed. Only create issues if a script doesn't work. If you found the owner for a script, start an issue with the readme file (or create a wiki page) and title it with the creator's name and a link to your proof (if its a wiki page, title it the name of the script that needs credited, then the description should include the creator's name and a link to your proof). I also try to post scripts that are unobsfucated.
